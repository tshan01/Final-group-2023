Gregorys coffee- Established in 2006, it's a latecomer compared to Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, but it has quickly grown to become a coffee shop known to every New Yorker. Gregorys Coffee stores are characterized by a trendy atmosphere, high-quality coffee, and a strong focus on healthy ingredients.
Brand Archetype-"Innovator" 
They use different ways in order to attract the customers which include，
-They offer cold-pressed juices, which I find very progressive for a coffee chain.
-They have a separate menu for vegans meanwhile, no other coffee shop has been so successful at meeting the needs of vegetarians and vegans.
-Another essential aspect of Gregorys Coffee's is that that they were the first to implement a mobile app ordering system, ahead of other coffee chains such as Starbucks. Users can place an order for Gregorys Coffee through the mobile app and the product will be waiting for them when they visit the store. For busy office workers, being able to order coffee without spending their break standing in line is a huge advantage.
