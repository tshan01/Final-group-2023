Business Description / Result of SWOT / Competitive Landscape
My business is a Cafe specializing in coffee roasted from the coffee beans procured from Coorg, India. The brand archetype(s) is Magician and the methods of persuasion that I will use are Mastery, Revelation, and Enchantment.  My persona is "Joey" and Joey is tired of the traditional cafes in the city and is looking for something a little entertaining and rich, so the concept for my business is a cafe with a The Great Gatsby theme that specializes in Arabica and Robusta coffee beans that is called “True Black”
Persona: Joey likes fantastical world movies with magical elements and thrillers such as Harry Potter, and Da Vinci Code.  He is tired of the typical cafes and would be attracted to a place that offers a magical atmosphere that reminds him of his favorite movies and high-quality coffee at a reasonable price with a whimsical experience.
